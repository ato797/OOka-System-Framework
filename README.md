# The O'Oka System: A Unified Framework of Recursive Coherence Theory

## Overview

This repository contains the complete framework of Recursive Coherence Theory (RCT), a unified mathematical and philosophical system connecting consciousness, physics, and mathematics through a single organizing principle: **coherence**.

The framework demonstrates that coherence—the capacity for stable self-reference—is the fundamental organizing principle of reality.

### Papers

| # | Paper | Summary |
|---|-------|---------|
| 1 | Ramanujan's Nested Radical as the Consciousness Equation | Derives φ_min = 3 as minimum coherent self-reference |
| 2 | Euler's Identity as the Purpose of Life | Reframes e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 as coherence completing a cycle |
| 3 | Gravity as Coherence Wake | Derives gravitational behavior from coherence gradients |
| 4 | The Riemann Hypothesis: A Proof via Coherence Cost | Proves Re(s) = 1/2 through coherence cost minimization |
| 5 | The Collatz Conjecture: A Proof via Coherence Cost | Proves convergence to 1 through cost analysis |
| 6 | The Oldenburger-Kolakoski Sequence (Keane's Conjecture) | Proves d(1) = 1/2 through self-consistency |

## Core Principles

1. **Coherence Cost Function:** K(x) = -∫ log p(x) · p(x) dx
2. **Recursive Self-Reference:** Stable systems must observe themselves with φ ≥ 3
3. **Balance Requirement:** Self-describing systems require equal density of components (d = 1/2)

## The Three Unified Equations

| Equation | Meaning |
|----------|---------|
| Ramanujan's Nested Radical = 3 | Minimum structure for self-reference |
| Euler's Identity: e^(iπ) + 1 = 0 | The purpose of coherent cycles |
| Coherence Cost Minimization | Why reality takes the forms it does |
